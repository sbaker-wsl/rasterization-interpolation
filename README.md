# rasterization-interpolation

This repository is meant to serve as an accumulation of the work I completed as part of a directed study for the fall term of 2025 at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown.

[View the final report for the study here](Fall_Directed_Study_Report_2025.pdf)

[View the source code for triangle rasterization and interpolation here](vga.v)

The source code was developed using alanswx's MiSTer tutorial linked here:
